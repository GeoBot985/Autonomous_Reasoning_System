# 🧠 Autonomous Reasoning System

A modular AI framework that simulates autonomous reasoning, reflection, and memory in an agentic system.  
Designed to explore how artificial cognition can evolve from reactive chat to **self-directed reasoning**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Autonomous Reasoning System (ARS)** is a Python-based experimental architecture for building cognitive agents capable of:
- Understanding context and intent  
- Reflecting on previous interactions  
- Formulating reasoning plans  
- Managing episodic and vector-based memory  
- Executing autonomous goals via modular controllers  

It forms the foundation for *Tyrone*, a continuously learning, reasoning-driven assistant built for adaptive knowledge management.

## 🧩 Key Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **core_loop** | Main orchestration loop controlling perception, reasoning, and response. |
| **memory** | Hybrid memory layer combining structured and semantic (vector) memory for context retrieval. |
| **reflection** | Enables the agent to assess confidence, summarize experiences, and learn from past actions. |
| **intent** | Parses user input to identify goals, actions, and entities. |
| **control** | High-level management layer that routes tasks, monitors execution, and enforces consistency. |
| **llm** | Interfaces with language models (via Ollama or API) for reasoning, planning, and dialogue. |

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Ollama / local LLM backend**
- **FAISS / Parquet / DuckDB** for vector and structured storage
- **LangChain-style orchestration** (custom implementation)
- **VS Code + virtual environments** for modular development

## 🧠 Concept

ARS is inspired by principles of **architectural cognition** — the idea that an AI system can organize its own reasoning flow much like a human mind:
- **Perception → Reflection → Planning → Action → Learning**
- With **episodic recall** and **confidence tracking** to regulate its own decision quality.

🧩 Vision

The long-term goal is to evolve ARS into a self-managing cognitive layer capable of:

Self-evaluation and confidence weighting

Long-term knowledge retention

Context-sensitive memory prioritization

Multi-agent collaboration
